This java program when compiled as a runnable jar is to be run on
a Raspberry Pi, with a arduino connected to one of the USB ports.

Compile the java program or use the already provided one, with 32-bits JDK
and not 64-bit that's used in most modern computers.

The program can be run like this:
java -Djava.library.path="/home/pi/lib/" -jar socketIO.jar

where at /home/pi/lib you put the contents of the lib folder provided here as well.
The default port to listen to connections is 8787.


If you want everything to run on boot, so you don't have
to manually start the program everytime, use the startUpScript.sh.

Place it in your /home/pi folder and then edit the /etc/rc.local file:
sudo nano /etc/rc.local

add in the line BEFORE the end:
sh /home/pi/startUpScript.sh

Our /etc/rc.local file looks like this:

#!/bin/sh -e
#
# rc.local
#
# This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.
# Make sure that the script will "exit 0" on success or any other
# value on error.
#
# In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution
# bits.
#
# By default this script does nothing.

# Print the IP address
_IP=$(hostname -I) || true
if [ "$_IP" ]; then
  printf "My IP address is %s\n" "$_IP"
fi
sh /home/pi/startUpScript.sh
exit 0



Now, every time you power up, you should be getting the camera and
the IORelay java program running as well!
