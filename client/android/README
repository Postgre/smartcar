The android app for the smartcar project by Team Pegasus.
Either compile it yourself, changing what you need, or use the
apk, located in SmartCarControl/bin/.

It will connect automatically to the specified MAC Address defined
in SmartCarControl/src/se/chalmers/balmung/smartcar/SettingsActivity.java
IF the device is configured to be connected in a network created by
the android phone via tethering. Otherwise, set the vehicle's IP manually
in the settings page.
