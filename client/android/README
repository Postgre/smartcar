The android app for the smartcar project by Team Pegasus.
Either compile it yourself, changing what you need, or use the
apk, located in SmartCarControl/bin/.

It will connect automatically to the specified MAC Address defined
in SmartCarControl/src/se/chalmers/balmung/smartcar/SettingsActivity.java
IF the device is configured to be connected in a network created by
the android phone via tethering. Otherwise, set the vehicle's IP manually
in the settings page.

In order to get the camera feed working, here are the instructions:

1. Install apache:
sudo apt-get install apache2 php5 libapache2-mod-php5

2. install raspimjpeg:
sudo apt-get install cmake
git clone https://github.com/silvanmelchior/userland.git
cd userland
./buildme
sudo ln -s /opt/vc/bin/raspimjpeg /usr/bin/raspimjpeg

3. configure apache to listen to correct folder:
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/default

make the following changes to the file:
> change  DocumentRoot to: /dev/shm/www
> change to Directory to:  /dev/shm/www

control + O to save, control + x to exit the nano

4. restart raspberry pi
sudo reboot

5. After rebooting in order to run the camera (you will have to do this everytime or create a script to do this for you)
sudo mkdir /dev/shm/www/
sudo raspimjpeg -w 320 -h 240 -d 1 -of /dev/shm/www/pic.jpg


Now you should be ready to stream from your android client!
Just point it to the http://<vehicle_ip>/pic.jpg
