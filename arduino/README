Arduino code to be used in the smartcar project by Team Pegasus
as published on https://github.com/platisd/smartcar.git
A client sends speed and angle data to a raspberry pi
raspberry pi computes how much speed each motor should have
and arduino (connected to RPi's USB port) interprets that data
and drives the motors. An ADAFRUIT motor shield is used based on
the L293D chip
